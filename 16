#Make a program for a paint store. The program should ask for the size in square meters of the area to be painted. Consider that the coverage of the paint is 1 liter for every 3 square meters and that the paint is sold in 18 liter cans, which cost R$ 80.00. Inform the user the quantity of paint cans to be purchased and the total price.
size = float(input('Insert the size (m2): '))
liter = size/3
can =18
price=80
if liter <= can:
    print(f'You will need {liter:.1f} liter(s). The price will be R$ {price}.')
else:
    cans=round(liter/can)
    print(f'You will need {liter:.1f} liters and {cans} cans. The price will be R$ {price*cans:.2f}.')
