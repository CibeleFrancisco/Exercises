'''Make a Program that asks how much tjr user earn per hour and the number of hours worked in the month. 
Calculate and show your total salary in that month, knowing that 11% is deducted for Income Tax, 8% for INSS and 5% for the union,
make a program that gives us:
gross salary.
how much did he pay to the INSS.
How much did he pay the union?
the net salary.
calculate the deductions and the net salary, according to the table below:
+ Gross Salary: R$
- IR (11%): R$
- INSS (8%): R$
- Union (5%): R$
= Net Salary: R$'''
perhour = float(input(" Inset how much do you earn per hour: R$ "))
hour = float(input("How many hours did you work: "))
salary = perhour*hour
IR = salary*0.11
INSS = salary*0.08
union = salary*0.05
print(f'+ Gross Salary: R${salary:.2f}')
print(f'- IR (11%): R$ {IR:.2f}')
print(f'- INSS (8%): R$ {IR:.2f}')
print(f'- Union (5%): R$ {union:.2f}')
print(f'= Net Salary: R$ {salary-IR-INSS-union:.2f}')
